                        Iâ€™m a world-renowned filmmaker who, for the past 9 years of my
                        26-years career have specialized in creating incredible cinematic
                        images no matter what the camera. Some of my most iconic work was
                        created with Canon DSLRs. Sloping each project alongside the
                        communities at the heart of her stories in order to ensure
                        authenticity.
